# I'm a dreamer.

Yep, I love day dreaming. As much as that, I love working on new ideas and trying out new things.

I've experience as a Webmaster, Content Creator and Digital Marketer (SEO, SMO). I've worked with several companies, like [Bitdefender](http://bitdefender.co.uk/) and [Amasty](http://amasty.com/).

Before passing my high school I started making thousands of dollars online via Freelancing, Google Adsense and ClickBank.

I've created ads for brands, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3c3GyQJVpk) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2In8M57bdY).

I love making videos with my buddy, [Hirak](http://facebook.com/Hirakjsarma/). We have shot two videos for <b>Don Bosco University</b> together. One about [Campus Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQvrTI0l98) and another about [Entrepreneurship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQvrTI0l98).

I've also worked with [RoughItOut](https://www.instagram.com/roughitout/) and [Metropolis Asia](https://www.instagram.com/metropolisasia/) teams. Check out their Insta. You will love them. :)

My works have reached millions of people on Facebook and some have been featured on popular pages like [TVF](http://facebook.com/sabqtiyapahai/), [CampusDiaries](https://campusdiaries.com/), [HellBoundBloggers](http://www.hellboundbloggers.com/) and [FamousBloggers](http://famousbloggers.net/).

I was also one of the top 20 influencers on [Triberr](http://triberr.com/) according to [BloggingHouse](http://www.blogginghouse.com/top-100-triberr-bloggers/) and [BloggingSpell](http://www.bloggingspell.com/triberr-marketing-tips/).

I'm pursuing <b>Engineering</b> in Computer Science and IT.

"Programming is Magical", I believe.

I build apps using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) & [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

Presently, I'm working on my new startup. And I've got in to [Google Startup Launch](https://developers.google.com/startups/) program.

I've gained experiences from many amazing people. And the journey has been great so far. :)

Rest assured, my future is not that dark after all.
