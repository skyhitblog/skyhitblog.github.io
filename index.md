# I'm a dreamer.

I love working on new ideas and trying out new things.

I've experience as a Web Master, Content Writer and Digital Marketer (SEO, SMO) and have worked with several companies like [BitDefender](http://bitdefender.co.uk), [Amasty](http://amasty.com/) and [Imonomy](http://imonomy.com/).

I've created ads for brands, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3c3GyQJVpk) and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2In8M57bdY).

I love making videos with my buddy [Hirak](http://facebook.com/Hirakjsarma). We have shot two videos for <b>Assam Don Bosco University</b> together. One about [Campus Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQvrTI0l98&t=231s) and another on [Exploring and Innovating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQvrTI0l98&t=231s) something new.

I've also worked with some of the Event teams. Notably, [RoughItOut](https://www.instagram.com/roughitout/) and [Metropolis Asia](https://www.instagram.com/metropolisasia/). Go check out their Insta. You will love them. :)

My works have reached millions of people on Facebook and some have been featured on popular pages like [TVF](http://facebook.com/sabqtiyapahai/?fref=ts), [HellBoundBloggers](http://www.hellboundbloggers.com), [BloggingCage](http://www.bloggingcage.com) and [FamousBloggers](http://famousbloggers.net).

I was also one of the top 20 influencers on [Triberr](http://triberr.com) according to [BloggingHouse](http://www.blogginghouse.com/top-100-triberr-bloggers/) and [BloggingSpell](http://www.bloggingspell.com/triberr-marketing-tips/).

I've some great experiences with some of the most awesome people I've met.

Right now, I'm pursuing Engineering in <b>Computer Science and IT</b>. My academic projects have been on <b>Cloud Computing</b> and another on <b>Traffic Analyzing with Raspberry Pi</b>.

I believe, "Programming is Magical". I'm learning Android in my free time. I build apps with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

Presently, I'm working on my new startup. Rest assured, my future is not that dark after all. ;)
