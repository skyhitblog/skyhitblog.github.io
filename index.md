# Fusion of Tech x Art.

I’m a day dreamer. Probably I day dream more than I should. You will always find me working on cool new ideas!

I’m a big fan of good design. In my free time I play Catan & Dead by Daylight.

I’m a bitcoin and blockchain enthusiast. I really believe that the technology will help decentralise some highly centralised ecosystems and bring power back to the people.

I love writing and producing films with my amazing team at Alchemy Pixels. I also develop  web apps and mobile apps to help launch businesses.

We have worked with some of the best artists like Benny Dayal, Nick Murphy, Taba Chake to name a few.

My love for good stories, music and food is endless. 

I’ve had amazing experiences working with everyone. The journey has been great so far. :)
