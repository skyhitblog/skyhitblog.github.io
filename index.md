# I'm a day dreamer.

Yep, I day dream a lot. As much as that, I love working on new ideas and trying out new things. I've recently launched [Inherit I/O](http://inheritio.com) and [Northeast Creatives](http://northeastcreatives.com). ðŸš€

I've experience as a Webmaster, Content Creator and Digital Marketer. Worked with companies like Bitdefender and Amasty.

Before passing my high school I started making thousands of dollars online via Blogging and Freelancing.

I've created ads for brands like [Poptales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3c3GyQJVpk) and organizations like [Assam Don Bosco University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2In8M57bdY).

I love making videos with my buddy, [Hirak](http://facebook.com/Hirakjsarma/). We have shot two videos, one on [Campus Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQvrTI0l98) and another on [Entrepreneurship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA-7HYLgIG8).

I've also worked with [RoughItOut](https://www.instagram.com/roughitout/) and [Metropolis Asia](https://www.instagram.com/metropolisasia/) teams. Check out their Insta. You will love them. :)

My works have reached millions of people on Facebook and have been featured on popular pages like TVF, CampusDiaries, HellBoundBloggers and FamousBloggers.

I was one of the top 20 influencers on Triberr.com according to BloggingHouse and BloggingSpell.

Right now I'm pursuing <b>Engineering</b> in Computer Science and IT.

I build apps using Ruby on Rails & React Native.

Presently, I'm working on my new startup.

I've gained experiences from many amazing people. And the journey has been great so far. :)
