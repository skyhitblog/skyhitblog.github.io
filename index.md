# I'm a day dreamer. I inspire myself.

Probably I day dream more than I should. And always working on new projects and new ideas.

I'm a Computer Engineer. I've always been very passionate about computers and tech in general since my school days.

I work with several clients by providing my technological and design solutions through my firm INHERIT IO.

I'm also a cofounder at [Alchemy Pixels](http://alchemypixels.com), a film production house based in Guwahati, Northeast India. 

We have worked with clients like Pinkathon, The British Council and Don Bosco University.

I used to do Blogging and Freelancing; but now I'm more involved in Product Development and Filmmaking.

I love Math, playing Chess and Catan. And my love for music and food is endless. 

I'm also a Bitcoin enthusiast and a big Musk fan. I believe in going off-grid and decentralizing things.

In my life I've gained a lot of experience by working with some really amazing people. The journey has been great so far. :)

Want to collaborate? [Drop me an email](mailto:avi@alchemypixels.com) and I'll catch up.
