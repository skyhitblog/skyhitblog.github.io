# I'm a day dreamer.

I day dream a lot. That inspires me to work on new ideas.

I've worked with organisations like The British Council and Don Bosco University.

I have experience as a Developer, Webmaster, Content Creator and Digital Marketer.

Before passing my high school I started making money online via Blogging and Freelancing.

I love building apps. I use Ruby on Rails & React Native. ðŸš€ 

And I love making videos with my team [Alchemy Pixels](http://alchemypixels.com).

We have created ads for brands and videos for artists. You may go through our [Youtube](http://youtube.com/alchemypixels) and [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/alchemypixels).

My design works have reached millions of people on Facebook and have been featured on popular pages like TVF and CampusDiaries.

In my life I've gained a lot of experience by working with some amazing people. The journey has been great so far. :)
