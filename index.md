# I'm a day dreamer.

Probably I day dream more than I should. And you will always find me working on new projects and ideas.

I'm a Computer Engineer. I've always been very passionate about computers and tech in general since my school days.

I work with several clients and provide my technological & design solutions through INHERIT.

I'm a cofounder of [Alchemy Pixels](http://alchemypixels.com), a film production house based in Guwahati, Northeast India. 

I love Math, playing Chess and Catan. And my love for good stories, music and food is endless. 

I'm also a Bitcoin enthusiast and a big Musk fan. I believe in going off-grid & decentralizing things.

I've gained a lot of experience by working with some really amazing people. The journey has been great so far. :)

Also I'm sorry if you were here for the blog. It's long gone, but will be back someday!

Want to collaborate? [Drop me an email](mailto:avi@alchemypixels.com) and I'll catch up.
