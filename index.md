# I'm a day dreamer.

I day dream a lot. As much as that, I love working on new ideas. I've recently launched [Inherit I/O](http://inheritio.com) and [Northeast Creatives](http://northeastcreatives.com). ðŸš€

Worked with companies like Bitdefender and Amasty, I've an experience as a Webmaster, Content Creator and Digital Marketer.

Before passing my high school I started making thousands of dollars online via Blogging and Freelancing.

Together with my friends, we have created ads for brands like [Poptales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3c3GyQJVpk) and influential organizations like [Assam Don Bosco University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2In8M57bdY).

I love making videos with my buddy, [Hirak](http://facebook.com/Hirakjsarma/) and team [Alchemy Pixels](https://www.instagram.com/alchemypixels/).

We have also worked with [RoughItOut](https://www.instagram.com/roughitout/) and [Metropolis Asia](https://www.instagram.com/metropolisasia/) and many other teams.

My works have reached millions of people on Facebook and have been featured on popular pages like TVF and CampusDiaries.

Right now I'm pursuing Engineering in Computer Science and IT.

I love building apps using Ruby on Rails & React Native.

Presently, I'm working on my new startup [FoodSpace](http://foodspace.in). We deliver whole foods to your doorstep and have a goal of bridging the gap between food producers and consumers.

I've gained a lot of experience by working with many amazing people. The journey has been great so far. :)
