# I'm a day dreamer.

I day dream a lot. As much as that, I love working on new ideas.

I've worked with companies like Bitdefender and Amasty, I've an experience as a Developer, Webmaster, Content Creator and Digital Marketer.

Before passing my high school I started making money online via Blogging and Freelancing.

We have created ads for brands like [Poptales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3c3GyQJVpk) and influential organizations like [Assam Don Bosco University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2In8M57bdY).

I love making videos with my buddy, [Hirak](http://facebook.com/Hirakjsarma/) and team [Alchemy Pixels](https://www.instagram.com/alchemypixels/). He's a great videographer. You should check his work.

We have also worked with the teams of [RoughItOut](https://www.instagram.com/roughitout/) and [Metropolis Asia](https://www.instagram.com/metropolisasia/) and many other teams.

My works have reached millions of people on Facebook and have been featured on popular pages like TVF and CampusDiaries.

Right now I'm pursuing Engineering in Computer Science and IT.

I love building apps using Ruby on Rails & React Native. ðŸš€ 

I've gained a lot of experience by working with many amazing people. The journey has been great so far. :)
